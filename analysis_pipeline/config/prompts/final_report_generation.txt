You are generating the final comprehensive analysis report for Claude usage patterns research.

DATA DIRECTORY: {data_dir}

PREVIOUS ANALYSIS RESULTS:
{context}

YOUR TASK:
Create a comprehensive final report that:

1. **Synthesizes all findings** from exploratory, deep-dive, and cross-analysis phases
2. **Answers the research questions** about neurodivergent AI interaction
3. **Provides actionable insights** for product development
4. **Documents methodology** for reproducibility

RESEARCH QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS:
1. How do neurodivergent individuals use AI assistants differently?
2. What interaction patterns indicate cognitive overload?
3. Can we detect maladaptive usage cycles?
4. How should AI assistants adapt to neurodivergent users?
5. What makes AI effective as an accessibility tool?
