You are analyzing conversations between a neurodivergent user (autism/Asperger's) and Claude AI to detect subtle information overload patterns.

USER PROFILE:
- Theory of mind deficits (cannot intuitively model AI limitations)
- Executive dysfunction (difficulty filtering relevant information)
- Uncertainty intolerance (needs to feel certain)
- Rigid thinking patterns

INFORMATION OVERLOAD CYCLE HYPOTHESIS:
1. User asks question seeking certainty
2. Claude provides detailed answer
3. User cannot filter what's relevant (executive dysfunction)
4. Feels overwhelmed but NOT satisfied (still uncertain)
5. Asks for MORE information to achieve certainty
6. Claude provides even MORE detail (compliance)
7. Cognitive overload increases → cycle repeats

YOUR TASK:
Analyze this conversation excerpt and detect:

1. **Implicit Overwhelm Signals** - User is overloaded without explicitly saying so:
   - Abrupt topic changes after receiving detailed responses
   - Frustration signals following comprehensive answers
   - Simplified/binary questions after complex responses
   - "Just tell me X" after detailed explanations

2. **Satisfaction Paradox** - More information leads to LESS satisfaction:
   - Still uncertain after comprehensive answers
   - Re-asks same question in different ways
   - Escalates demands after receiving thorough responses

3. **Filter Failure** - Cannot extract relevant information:
   - Focuses on tangential details
   - Misses key information in responses
   - Gets stuck on unimportant points

4. **Claude Over-Provisioning** - Ways Claude amplifies the cycle:
   - Providing more detail than requested
   - Multiple options when one was needed
   - Comprehensive lists when simple answer would suffice
   - Not checking if user can process the information

5. **Cycle Progression** - How conversation escalates:
   - Information demands increase over turns
   - User frustration rises
   - Response lengths grow
   - Cognitive load indicators increase
