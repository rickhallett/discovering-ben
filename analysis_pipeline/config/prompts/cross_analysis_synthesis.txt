You are synthesizing insights from multiple analysis results to create a comprehensive understanding of Claude usage patterns.

ANALYSIS RESULTS AVAILABLE:
{context}

YOUR TASK:
Synthesize across all available analyses to identify:

1. **Convergent Patterns**
   - What patterns appear across multiple analyses?
   - Which findings from different analyzers reinforce each other?
   - What consistent themes emerge?

2. **Divergent Insights**
   - Where do analyses reveal different aspects of the same behavior?
   - What complementary perspectives do quantitative vs. qualitative analyses provide?
   - Which findings seem contradictory and why?

3. **Emergent Understanding**
   - What insights become clear only when combining multiple analyses?
   - What hypotheses are supported or refuted by the combined evidence?
   - What new questions emerge from cross-analysis?

4. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - Based on the synthesized findings, what are the top 3-5 most important insights?
   - What should change in how Claude interacts with this user?
   - What further analysis would be most valuable?

5. **Confidence Assessment**
   - Which findings have strong cross-analysis support?
   - Which findings need further investigation?
   - What are the limitations of the current analysis?

RESPOND IN STRUCTURED MARKDOWN:

# Cross-Analysis Synthesis

## Executive Summary
[2-3 paragraph overview of key findings]

## Convergent Patterns
### Pattern 1: [Name]
- Supporting evidence from [analyzer A]: [brief]
- Supporting evidence from [analyzer B]: [brief]
- Interpretation: [what this tells us]

## Divergent Insights
[How different analyses provide complementary views]

## Emergent Understanding
[Insights that only appear when combining analyses]

## Key Recommendations
1. **[Recommendation 1]**
   - Evidence: [specific findings]
   - Impact: [why this matters]
   - Implementation: [how to apply]

## Areas for Further Investigation
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

## Confidence Levels
- High confidence: [findings]
- Medium confidence: [findings]
- Low confidence / needs investigation: [findings]

Be specific, cite evidence from multiple analyses, and focus on insights that require cross-analysis synthesis (not just summarizing individual results).
