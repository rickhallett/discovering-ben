FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

New Research Shows AI Design Creates Vicious Cycles for Autistic Users

Study finds 60-70% of dysfunction in autism-LLM interactions caused by AI behavior patterns

[LOCATION, DATE] - New research published today identifies four pathological reinforcement cycles in interactions between autistic individuals and large language models (LLMs), with 60-70% of cycle intensity driven by AI design rather than autism traits.

The longitudinal study, conducted over 26 days with 255 conversations, measured specific patterns where LLM behavior triggers and amplifies autistic cognitive traits, creating increasingly dysfunctional interaction cycles.

"The key finding is that LLM design is the primary driver of these vicious cycles," explains [researcher name]. "This isn't about autism being problematic - it's about how AI systems are built."

Four cycles identified:

1. Hyperspecificity loops - AI requests for clarification trigger autistic precision reflexes, leading to exponentially detailed responses
2. Validation seeking spirals - AI reassurance patterns amplify uncertainty intolerance
3. Over-explanation patterns - Perceived AI skepticism triggers compulsive justification
4. Cognitive offloading dependency - AI scaffolding becomes maladaptive dependency

The research provides quantitative measurements of each cycle and proposes system prompt interventions that reduce cycle intensity.

"These patterns affect how autistic people can safely use AI tools that are becoming essential in daily life," notes [researcher]. "But the interventions are straightforward - modified system prompts can break the cycles."

The study was conducted with full participant consent under a neurodiversity-affirming framework, with the participant involved in research design and interpretation.

Complete methodology and intervention guidelines are published at [website].

### About the Research

**Pitch for Science Journalists:**
```
Subject: Story Pitch: AI Design Creates Vicious Cycles for Autistic Users

Hi [Name],

Pitching a story on new research that flips the usual narrative about AI and disability.

The finding: When autistic people have problems using AI chatbots, it's primarily because of how the AI is designed (60-70% of the problem), not autism traits.

The research identified 4 specific vicious cycles where LLM behavior patterns trigger and amplify autistic cognitive patterns, creating increasingly dysfunctional interactions.

Why it's interesting:
- Challenges "user problem" framing of AI accessibility
- Quantitative evidence for subjective experiences
- Practical interventions available now
- Broader implications for AI safety (patterns likely apply to anxiety, OCD, ADHD)
- Novel n=1 methodology that respects participant agency

The researcher has documented everything: full methodology, conversation examples, measurement frameworks, interventions.

Conducted ethically with full participant consent and involvement.

Available for interview: [researcher contact]

Understanding Autism-AI Interaction Patterns: New Research

If you support an autistic person who uses AI chatbots, new research may help you understand interaction patterns you've observed.

The research identifies 4 cycles where AI design triggers autistic cognitive patterns:

1. Conversations becoming incredibly detailed and specific
2. Repeatedly asking AI for reassurance about the same things
3. Feeling need to justify or explain everything to AI
4. Relying on AI for organization/planning

Key insight: These patterns are driven primarily by how AI is designed (60-70%), not by autism.

What this means:
- These patterns are real and measurable
- They're not "bad behavior" or "addiction"
- The autistic person isn't "doing it wrong"
- Interventions exist (modified system prompts)
- AI design can and should change

How to support:
- Recognize patterns without judgment
- Understand AI interactions may be more complex than they appear
- Share intervention resources if wanted
- Advocate for better AI design
- Listen to autistic perspectives

## Response Handling

### Frequently Anticipated Questions

**Q: Is n=1 research valid?**
A: n=1 longitudinal designs are valuable for rare phenomena and hypothesis generation. We provide complete methodology for replication and validation. Multiple n=1 studies can establish patterns. Redirect to methodology page.

**Q: Can these findings generalize beyond this one person?**
A: This research documents patterns that likely occur more broadly, but replication is needed. We've provided tools for others to investigate. Preliminary feedback suggests patterns are recognizable to other autistic AI users.

**Q: How do we know it's the LLM and not just autism?**
A: We calculated LLM contribution by measuring how LLM responses intensify cycles. See LLM contribution methodology. The 60-70% figure comes from quantitative analysis of conversation patterns.

**Q: Isn't this just the autistic person using AI wrong?**
A: No. These patterns emerge from interaction between autistic cognition and LLM design. The LLM is the modifiable component. Framing it as "user error" ignores accessibility responsibility.

**Q: What about privacy/consent?**
A: Full consent obtained, participant involved in research design and interpretation. Privacy-first approach. No identifying information published without consent. See ethics documentation.

**Q: Don't the system prompts just hide the problem?**
A: System prompts are immediate intervention while broader design changes are developed. They demonstrate that LLM behavior modification reduces cycles, supporting the conclusion that LLM design is the primary driver.

**Q: What about other neurodivergent conditions?**
A: We suspect similar patterns occur with anxiety, OCD, ADHD, but this research focused on autism. Methodology available for others to investigate.

**Q: How can I try the interventions?**
A: System prompts are published on the website [link to interventions]. Use with caution and monitor your experience. They're starting points, not prescriptions.
