# Case Study: Successful Intervention

> **Status:** Pending Wave 2 intervention effectiveness analysis

This case study will document real examples of successful system prompt interventions once Wave 2 data collection is complete.

## What This Page Will Include

When intervention effectiveness data becomes available, this page will provide:

- **Before/after conversation comparisons** showing the same cycle pattern pre- and post-intervention
- **Specific intervention strategies that worked** with the exact system prompt language that broke the cycle
- **Quantitative effectiveness metrics** comparing baseline rates to post-intervention outcomes
- **Lessons learned for implementation** identifying what made certain interventions more effective than others

## Current Status

**System Prompts Deployed:** January 16, 2025

The intervention system prompts (v1) have been implemented based on Wave 1 vicious cycles analysis. These interventions target:

- Cycle 1: Information overload (information scoping before comprehensive responses)
- Cycle 2: Decision paralysis (binary recommendations instead of multiple options)
- Cycle 3: Perfectionism escalation (explicit completion declarations)
- Cycle 4: Emotional dysregulation (acknowledge emotion before task-focus)

**Target Effectiveness Metrics:**

- Reduce decision abandonment from 92.2% to <50%
- Reduce unresolved tasks from 71.9% to <40%
- Enable emotional baseline return (currently 0%)
- Reduce information overwhelm complaints

**Data Collection Phase:**

Wave 2 effectiveness data collection is in progress. Real before/after conversation comparisons will be analyzed to determine which interventions successfully broke vicious reinforcement cycles and which require refinement.

## Data Integrity Commitment

This research follows strict principles of using only real data. No hypothetical scenarios will be presented as case studies.

When actual intervention effectiveness becomes measurable through conversation analysis, this page will document:

1. The specific vicious cycle pattern that occurred before intervention
2. The exact system prompt modification that was deployed
3. Observable changes in interaction patterns after intervention
4. Quantitative improvements (if measurable)
5. Analysis of why the intervention succeeded

Until that data exists, this page remains a placeholder to maintain research integrity.
