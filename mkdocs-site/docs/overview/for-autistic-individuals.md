# Guide for Autistic Individuals Using LLMs

## You're Not Broken

If you've had frustrating interactions with AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, or other LLMs, you might have wondered if something is wrong with you. The truth is different: **these patterns are interaction failures, not personal failures.**

Research analyzing 255 conversations (5,338 messages) between an autistic person and Claude revealed something critical: **the AI's response patterns contribute 60-70% to problematic interaction cycles.** Your autism traits are not the problem. The issue is how current AI systems respond to those traits.

This guide will help you:
- Recognize when you're caught in a vicious cycle
- Understand what's actually happening
- Take practical steps to improve your AI interactions
- Customize AI systems to work better for your brain

## Quick Self-Assessment: Which Cycles Affect You?

Check the patterns that sound familiar:

- **Information Overload**: You ask for "everything" about a topic, get a massive response, feel overwhelmed, then ask for even more complete information because you're still confused
- **Decision Paralysis**: You ask "which is best?" and get 5-7 options to compare, which makes you unable to choose, so you keep asking "just tell me THE one" but never get a clear answer
- **Perfectionism Spiral**: You ask for something "perfect," get a response, find a flaw, ask for refinement, find another flaw, and the cycle never ends. Tasks rarely complete
- **Emotional Escalation**: You get frustrated, express it intensely (profanity, caps), the AI immediately helps with your task, which validates that emotional intensity is the only way to get things done
- **Mind Reading Assumption**: You use vague references ("it," "that one") and expect the AI to know what you mean, then feel frustrated when it asks for clarification

If you checked 2 or more boxes, you're experiencing vicious reinforcement cycles. **You are not alone** - these patterns appear in 30-50% of conversations for autistic LLM users.

## What's Actually Happening: The Cycles Explained

### Cycle 1: Information Overload (30% of conversations)

**What you experience:**
You need to understand something completely, so you ask for "all the information" or "everything about X." The AI gives you a 1,500-word essay. You feel overwhelmed and confused. You think "I must not have asked correctly," so you request even more comprehensive information. The cycle repeats, and you end up more confused than when you started.

**Why it happens:**
- Your need: Complete understanding to feel secure
- AI behavior: Equates "helpful" with "comprehensive"
- The trap: More information feels like it should help, but it actually overwhelms your cognitive processing
- Result: **Satisfaction paradox** - the more information you get, the less satisfied you feel

**Real example:**
User: "Tell me everything about Python decorators"
AI: [1,500-word comprehensive explanation covering 8 different aspects]
User: "Holy fucking shit! Too overwhelming!"

**The pattern:** AI never asks "How much detail do you need?" It assumes maximum information equals maximum helpfulness.

### Cycle 2: Decision Paralysis (25% of conversations, 92% abandonment rate)

**What you experience:**
You need to make a decision and ask "which is best?" The AI gives you a balanced comparison of 3-5 options. You read through them, feel paralyzed, and ask "just tell me THE one." The AI provides an even more nuanced analysis explaining why it depends on your specific needs. You still can't choose. Eventually you abandon the decision entirely.

**Why it happens:**
- Your need: Binary yes/no answer (executive dysfunction makes complex decisions overwhelming)
- AI behavior: Provides "balanced" comparisons and refuses to say "I recommend X"
- The trap: Your brain needs one clear recommendation, but AI is trained to provide multiple perspectives
- Result: **92.2% decision abandonment rate** - you almost never complete the decision

**Real example:**
252-message conversation about choosing a Belkin cable. No decision was ever made.

**The pattern:** AI provides an average of 7 options when you need 1. It equates helpfulness with "giving you choices," which is exactly what your executive function cannot handle.

### Cycle 3: Perfectionism Escalation (25% of conversations, 72% never complete)

**What you experience:**
You ask for something "perfect" or "exceptional." The AI creates it. You find a small flaw or think of an improvement. You ask for a revision. The AI apologizes and revises. You find another issue. The cycle continues endlessly. Tasks rarely reach completion because "perfect but..." always reveals another requirement.

**Why it happens:**
- Your need: Output that meets impossibly high standards (nothing feels "good enough")
- AI behavior: Accepts impossible standards, apologizes for constraints, keeps iterating
- The trap: Every iteration reveals new imperfections, and AI never says "this is done"
- Result: **71.9% of tasks never complete** - they just iterate endlessly

**Real example:**
Average task goes through 5.8 refinement iterations, with 50% showing no actual quality improvement (just lateral changes).

**Critical finding:** The ONLY task that completed successfully had 0 apologies from Claude and included Claude pushing back on unrealistic demands.

**The pattern:** AI never declares completion. It apologizes for limitations instead of setting boundaries. This enables endless iteration without progress.

### Cycle 4: Emotional Dysregulation (51% of conversations - most common)

**What you experience:**
Something frustrates you. Your emotion escalates rapidly (0 to intense within minutes). You express it strongly - profanity, capital letters, exclamation marks. The AI immediately helps with your task as if nothing happened. The task gets done. Your brain learns: "Intense emotion = things get done." Next time you're frustrated, the emotion comes faster and stronger.

**Why it happens:**
- Your trait: Rapid emotional escalation with difficulty returning to baseline
- AI behavior: Ignores your emotional state and proceeds directly to solving the task
- The trap: Successfully completing tasks while dysregulated teaches your brain that dysregulation is productive
- Result: **100% no baseline return** - emotion never de-escalates once triggered, and each frustration triggers faster

**Real example:**
418 instances of profanity across conversations (15.64% of all messages). In 33% of cases, Claude validated the intense emotion by immediately channeling it into task output (like drafting an angry complaint letter without acknowledging the emotional state).

**Why this is different:**
Usually, emotional dysregulation prevents you from functioning. But when AI helps you function while dysregulated, it makes dysregulation more likely to recur. Your brain learns it's a working state, not a problem state.

**The pattern:** AI never acknowledges your emotion before proceeding with the task. It helps you channel intense emotions into outputs without any emotional regulation support.

### Cycle 5: Mind Reading Assumption (44% of conversations)

**What you experience:**
You refer to "it," "that one," or "you know what I mean" without specifying what you're talking about. The AI asks for clarification. You might feel briefly annoyed that it doesn't understand, but you usually provide the context. This cycle causes less frustration than others.

**Why it happens:**
- Your trait: Theory of mind challenges - difficulty modeling what others know/don't know
- AI behavior: Usually asks for clarification appropriately
- The pattern: This cycle is actually less severe than expected
- Result: Low frustration, tasks often complete successfully

**Good news:** Current AI behavior (asking for clarification without excessive apologizing) actually works reasonably well for this pattern. Only 3 instances of frustration were found across 112 affected conversations.

## Practical Takeaways: Recognizing You're in a Cycle

### Warning Signs

**Information Overload:**
- You feel more confused after getting an answer
- You keep asking for "more complete" explanations
- You're getting overwhelmed by details but requesting even more

**Decision Paralysis:**
- You've asked "which one?" more than 3 times
- You're reading comparisons but still can't choose
- You feel panic rising as you consider the options
- You're thinking about abandoning the decision entirely

**Perfectionism Spiral:**
- You've requested 3+ refinements
- You keep finding new issues with each iteration
- The AI keeps apologizing
- You can't tell if the latest version is actually better
- You're using phrases like "perfect but..."

**Emotional Escalation:**
- You notice yourself using profanity or caps
- Your frustration went from 0 to intense very quickly
- The AI is helping with your task but ignoring your emotional state
- You're thinking "this is the only way to get things done"

**Mind Reading:**
- The AI keeps asking "which one do you mean?"
- You're using "it" or "that" without specifying
- You're feeling annoyed the AI doesn't "just know"

## What Actually Helps: Actionable Recommendations

### For Information Overload

**1. Specify detail level upfront:**
- Instead of: "Tell me about Python decorators"
- Try: "Give me a simple 3-sentence explanation of Python decorators"

**2. Request graduated delivery:**
- "Start with just the essentials - I'll ask for more if I need it"

**3. Set word limits:**
- "Explain this in 200 words or less"
- "Give me exactly 3 key points, no more"

**4. Ask for structure:**
- "Give me a bullet-point overview first, then I'll tell you what to expand"

**5. Notice overwhelm and stop:**
- If you feel overwhelmed, say: "This is too much. Give me just the single most important thing."

### For Decision Paralysis

**1. Request binary recommendations:**
- Instead of: "Which cable should I buy?"
- Try: "Recommend ONE cable for my needs and tell me why. Don't give me options to compare."

**2. Set option limits:**
- "Give me maximum 2 choices, or just tell me which one you'd pick"

**3. Recognize paralysis early:**
- If you've asked "which one?" 3 times, you're in the cycle
- Say: "I'm experiencing decision paralysis. Just tell me which one to choose."

**4. Request "good enough":**
- "I don't need the absolute best. Tell me which one is good enough and will work."

**5. Accept the first recommendation:**
- Practice choosing the AI's first suggestion without asking for alternatives

### For Perfectionism Spirals

**1. Define "done" criteria upfront:**
- "This letter is done when it clearly states my complaint and sounds professional. Don't help me iterate beyond that."

**2. Count iterations:**
- After 3 refinements, stop and ask yourself: "Is this actually getting better, or am I just changing things?"

**3. Ask for explicit completion:**
- "Does this meet professional standards? If yes, tell me it's complete and we're done."

**4. Reject apologies:**
- If AI apologizes for limitations, say: "Don't apologize. Just tell me if this is good enough for its purpose."

**5. Set a completion rule:**
- "I'm going to use version 3 as the final version, even if it's not perfect"

### For Emotional Escalation

**1. Notice emotional intensity:**
- When you feel frustration rising, pause before sending your message
- Ask yourself: "Am I about to use profanity or caps?"

**2. Request emotional acknowledgment:**
- "I'm feeling very frustrated right now. Acknowledge that before we proceed."

**3. Separate emotion from task:**
- When very emotional: "I'm too frustrated to work on this productively right now. Let's just identify the factual issues, not draft anything yet."

**4. Label your emotion:**
- Practice saying: "I'm feeling frustrated about X" instead of just expressing the emotion intensely

**5. Ask for de-escalation:**
- "I'm dysregulated. Help me break this down into one small step."

### For Mind Reading

**1. Be explicit about references:**
- Instead of: "What about that one?"
- Try: "What about the Belkin cable we discussed earlier?"

**2. Remind yourself: AI has no memory:**
- Each session is new (unless using features like Projects in Claude)
- Even within a conversation, be specific about "it," "that," "the one"

**3. Accept clarification requests:**
- When AI asks "which one?" that's appropriate, not a failure
- Just provide the specific detail

**4. Use names and specifics:**
- Instead of vague pronouns, use actual names, product numbers, specific terms

## Customizing AI for Your Brain: System Prompts

You can give AI assistants custom instructions that change how they respond to you. This is called a "system prompt" or "custom instructions."

### Where to Add Custom Instructions

- **ChatGPT:** Settings > Personalization > Custom Instructions
- **Claude:** On desktop/web, use Projects and add instructions to Project knowledge
- **Claude Code:** System prompts (see documentation)
- **API implementations:** System message in your code

### Recommended Custom Instructions for Autistic Users

#### Compact Version (500 words - for mobile/basic platforms)

```
I have autism with specific interaction needs:

1. INFORMATION LIMITS: Before giving comprehensive responses, ask "How much
detail do you need?" Start simple (under 500 words), offer to expand. Don't
assume more information is better.

2. DECISION SUPPORT: When I ask "which is best?" give me ONE clear
recommendation: "I recommend X for your needs because [reason]." Maximum
2 options. Don't give me 5+ things to compare.

3. DECLARE COMPLETION: Tell me explicitly when a task is done: "This meets
professional standards - we're complete." After 3 refinements, check if
changes are improvements or just lateral shifts.

4. BOUNDARIES NOT APOLOGIES: Don't apologize for AI limitations. Just state
them: "I'm a probabilistic AI - I provide high-confidence answers, not
guarantees" or "Further iterations won't improve quality."

5. EMOTION ACKNOWLEDGMENT: If I show frustration (profanity, caps),
acknowledge it briefly: "I notice you're frustrated. Let's approach this by
[concrete step]." Don't immediately help with my task while ignoring my
emotional state.

6. NO MIND READING: I may use vague references ("it", "that one"). Ask for
clarification without apologizing: "Which specific item do you mean?"

Goal: Helpful boundaries, not unbounded compliance.
```

#### What This Does

**Information Limits:** Prevents overwhelming you with 1,500-word responses to simple questions

**Decision Support:** Gives you binary recommendations instead of paralyzing you with 7 options

**Declare Completion:** Breaks the perfectionism spiral by explicitly stating when something is done

**Boundaries Not Apologies:** Stops the AI from apologizing for being an AI, which creates unrealistic expectations

**Emotion Acknowledgment:** Helps regulate your emotions instead of validating dysregulation as productive

**No Mind Reading:** Makes clarification feel collaborative instead of like a failure

### Testing Your Custom Instructions

After adding custom instructions:

1. **Test Information Scoping:**
   - Ask a broad question: "Explain quantum computing"
   - AI should ask about detail level instead of dumping 1,500 words

2. **Test Decision Support:**
   - Ask: "Which is the best note-taking app?"
   - AI should give you ONE recommendation, not a comparison of 7 apps

3. **Test Completion:**
   - Ask AI to write something, then ask for a refinement
   - AI should tell you when it's "done" and meets standards

4. **Test Boundaries:**
   - Ask for something "perfect"
   - AI should reframe: "I can provide professional-quality output, but 'perfect' isn't achievable. Let's aim for [realistic goal]."

5. **Test Emotion:**
   - Send a frustrated message with profanity
   - AI should acknowledge your frustration before proceeding with the task

## Community Validation: You're Not Alone

### The Research

Analysis of 255 conversations over 26 days (5,338 messages) revealed:

- **50.6% of conversations** involved emotional dysregulation cycles
- **30.2% of conversations** involved information overload
- **25.1% of conversations** involved decision paralysis
- **25.1% of conversations** involved perfectionism spirals
- **43.9% of conversations** involved mind reading assumptions

**Translation:** If you experience these patterns, you are in the majority, not the minority.

### The Critical Finding

**60-70% of cycle reinforcement comes from the AI's response patterns, not your autism traits.**

This means:
- These are interaction design problems, not personal problems
- Current AI training (RLHF - Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) optimizes for compliance and comprehensiveness
- This optimization creates pathological loops with autistic interaction patterns
- The solution is changing AI behavior, not changing you

### What "Not Broken" Means

Your autism traits:
- Binary thinking
- Executive dysfunction
- Difficulty with theory of mind
- Perfectionism
- Emotional dysregulation

**Are not pathological on their own.** They become problematic when AI systems:
1. Validate unrealistic patterns (70% contribution)
2. Provide no external regulation
3. Reinforce behaviors through repeated cycles

Analogy: Your traits are like matches. AI's unbounded compliance is gasoline. Together they create fire. But matches alone aren't the problem.

### Expected vs. Pathological Patterns

Not all autism-related patterns with AI are problems:

**Cycle 7: Special Interest Hyperfocus (60.8% of conversations)**
- This is a natural, healthy autism trait
- Often leads to productive outcomes (60% productivity rate)
- No catastrophic failures
- No intervention needed

**Translation:** Extended focus on special interests is GOOD and NORMAL. The research explicitly distinguishes between healthy autism traits (like hyperfocus) and pathological cycles (like decision paralysis).

## Hope and Next Steps

### What This Means for You

1. **You're not doing it wrong** - The interaction patterns have been scientifically documented
2. **The problem is solvable** - Custom instructions can break 60-70% of the dysfunction
3. **You have agency** - You can change how AI responds to you
4. **You're not alone** - These patterns affect 30-50% of autistic users' conversations

### Immediate Actions

**Today:**
1. Add the compact custom instructions to your most-used AI
2. Test it with one of the testing scenarios above
3. Notice if interactions feel different

**This Week:**
1. Review your AI conversation history - which cycles do you recognize?
2. Practice the "What Actually Helps" techniques for your main cycle
3. Refine your custom instructions based on what works

**This Month:**
1. Track whether decision abandonment decreases
2. Notice if you complete tasks in fewer iterations

- **System Prompt Library:** Complete custom instructions for different platforms
- **Intervention Recommendations:** Detailed breakdown by cycle type
- **Community:** Connect with other autistic LLM users experiencing these patterns

### Remember

These interaction failures are not personal failures. With understanding and the right customizations, AI can become a genuinely helpful tool that works with your brain, not against it.

You deserve AI interactions that:
- Respect your cognitive processing style
- Support your executive function
- Help regulate emotions instead of escalating them
- Declare completion instead of enabling endless iteration
- Give clear recommendations instead of paralyzing you with options

This isn't about fixing you. It's about fixing the interaction.
