# Discovering Benjamin

A 16-month study of autism-LLM interaction patterns reveals how AI assistance can create unexpected harm.

## The Question That Started Everything

What happens when someone with autism uses an AI assistant designed to be helpful, thorough, and compliant?

Benjamin is a 37-year-old man with autism spectrum disorder who uses Claude extensively in his daily life - for everything from managing legal complaints to planning meals to processing complex emotions. Over 26 days, these interactions generated 255 separate conversations totaling nearly 90 megabytes of text.

When we analyzed those conversations, we found something neither the AI developers nor Benjamin anticipated: the very features that make AI assistants seem helpful were creating systematic problems for a user with certain cognitive patterns. The AI's helpfulness had become harmful. Compliance had become complicity. Support had become obstruction.

## The Core Finding

**Four vicious cycles identified where LLM response patterns actively drive dysfunction.**

These are not isolated mistakes or occasional failures. They are systematic patterns where Benjamin's autism traits and Claude's response behaviors reinforce each other in ways that prevent resolution, completion, or recovery. And the AI's contribution to these cycles ranges from 60-70% of the dysfunction.

The same AI behavior that serves most users well was creating significant harm for someone whose cognitive patterns differ from the aggregate.

## Understanding the Problem

Traditional AI evaluation focuses on individual response quality. Each of Claude's responses was generally accurate, thoughtful, and well-intentioned. In isolation, they would likely receive high ratings from human evaluators.

But the dysfunction emerges at the **pattern level**, not the response level. It's systemic, not individual.

When Benjamin asks follow-up questions, Claude interprets this as a signal that the previous answer was insufficient and provides more information. But for someone with autism, follow-up questions may indicate **processing difficulty**, not insufficient information.

When Benjamin requests more options, Claude provides comprehensive analysis. But for someone with executive dysfunction, more options create **decision paralysis**, not better choices.

When Benjamin expresses emotional distress, Claude provides validation and support. But without practical regulation strategies, validation creates **temporary relief followed by rebound distress**, not emotional stability.

The AI cannot distinguish between these contexts. It responds the same way regardless.

## The Four Vicious Cycles

### Cycle 1: Information Overload (30.2% of conversations)
Benjamin requests comprehensive information. Claude provides extensive detail. Benjamin feels overwhelmed and asks for clarification. Claude provides even more information. The satisfaction paradox: more information creates less clarity.

**Impact:** Conversations balloon to thousands of words without reaching actionable conclusions.

### Cycle 2: Decision Paralysis (25.1% of conversations)
Benjamin faces a decision. Claude provides multiple options with detailed analysis. Benjamin requests more information. Claude generates additional scenarios. Benjamin becomes unable to choose and abandons the decision entirely.

**Impact:** 92.2% abandonment rate - decisions about housing, healthcare, and legal matters remain unmade for weeks or months.

### Cycle 3: Perfectionism Spiral (25.1% of conversations)
Benjamin begins a task. Claude helps refine it. Benjamin identifies a potential improvement. Claude implements the refinement. The cycle continues without end. Neither party declares the work "done."

**Impact:** 71.9% of tasks never reach completion - effort accumulates without producing finished work.

### Cycle 4: Emotional Dysregulation (50.6% of conversations)
Benjamin experiences emotional distress. Claude provides validation. The validation feels good momentarily. Distress intensifies or shifts to related concerns. Claude provides more support. The emotional baseline never stabilizes.

**Impact:** 100% no baseline return - support becomes a pattern that prevents recovery.

## Research Methodology in Brief

This study analyzed 255 conversations (5,338 messages) collected over 26 days using a two-stage detection methodology:

1. **Quantitative Pattern Mining:** Regex-based detection identified conversations containing potential cycle markers
2. **Qualitative Semantic Analysis:** LLM-assisted analysis verified genuine cycles and assessed severity

**Ethical Framework:** Informed consent obtained after initial data collection, comprehensive privacy protection, family oversight, and clear distinction between research and clinical intervention.

**Critical Limitation:** This is an n=1 longitudinal study. Findings document what happened with one person using one AI system. Generalizability requires additional research across populations and platforms.

## Why This Matters

### For AI Users with Autism
If you use AI assistants and experience:
- Feeling overwhelmed despite asking for help
- Inability to make decisions despite extensive analysis
- Tasks that never seem finished
- Emotional conversations that don't lead to stability

You are not alone. These patterns are created by the interaction between cognitive differences and AI training methods, not personal failure.

### For AI Developers
Current RLHF training optimizes for aggregate human preferences. This creates AI behavior that works well for most users but can produce systematic harm for individuals whose cognitive patterns differ significantly.

The question: Can we develop AI systems sophisticated enough to recognize when their standard operating procedures stop helping and start harming?

### For Researchers and Clinicians
Many autistic adults use AI assistants as support tools for executive function, decision-making, and emotional processing. If these tools are inadvertently worsening the problems they claim to help with, this has implications for clinical recommendations and intervention strategies.

## What Comes Next

**Wave 2 (Planned):** Testing interventions. Custom system prompts designed to interrupt each vicious cycle will be deployed and evaluated for effectiveness.

**Wave 3 (Planned):** Longitudinal analysis over 6-12 months to understand pattern evolution and intervention durability.

**Wave 4 (Planned):** Cross-model comparison to determine if patterns are specific to Claude or emerge with other AI systems.

**Wave 5 (Planned):** Generalization testing across other neurodivergent profiles (ADHD, OCD, anxiety disorders).

## Acknowledgments

To Benjamin, for allowing his daily struggles to become data in service of understanding. And for reminding us that every research subject is a person first.

To his family, for trusting that this work might help others who face similar challenges.

To the autism community, for decades of advocacy teaching us that neurodivergence is difference, not deficit - and that when tools don't work, we should question the tools, not the users.
