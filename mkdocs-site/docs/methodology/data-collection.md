# Data Collection

## Dataset Overview

This research analyzes a unique dataset of authentic human-AI interactions between Benjamin (pseudonym) and Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant. The dataset represents real-world, unfiltered usage rather than controlled experimental conditions.

**Dataset Specifications:**
- **255 conversations** across diverse topics and contexts
- **5,338 total messages** (2,672 from Benjamin, 2,666 from Claude)
- **26 days** of interaction (October 20 - November 16, 2025)
- **89.5 MB** of conversation data
- **Single participant**: Benjamin, an autistic individual using Claude as a primary thinking partner
- **Platform**: Claude AI assistant (multiple model versions during the study period)

This nearly 1:1 message ratio (2,672 user to 2,666 Claude messages) indicates sustained, reciprocal interaction rather than one-sided consultation. Benjamin engaged with Claude across software development, creative projects, personal decision-making, and exploratory thinking.

## Consent and Privacy Framework

### Initial Consent Process

Benjamin provided informed consent for his conversation data to be analyzed and published for research purposes. This consent was obtained after the interactions had already occurred, making this a retrospective observational study of naturalistic AI usage.

The consent process involved:
- Clear explanation of the research goals: identifying potential vicious reinforcement cycles in autism-LLM interactions
- Description of how the data would be analyzed using both automated pattern detection and LLM-assisted semantic analysis
- Disclosure that findings would be made public to inform clinical practice, LLM design, and accessibility research
- Understanding that Benjamin's real name would be replaced with a pseudonym, but specific conversation content would be preserved for analytical validity

### Ongoing Family Approval

Given that Benjamin is an autistic adult whose cognitive processing patterns are central to this research, we established an ongoing consent framework involving family members who support Benjamin's care and decision-making.

This ongoing approval process includes:
- Regular updates on research findings and their implications
- Family review of how Benjamin is represented in published materials
- Opportunity to request removal or modification of specific examples that might be identified as harmful or misrepresentative
- Collaborative discussion about the balance between analytical honesty and respectful representation

This approach acknowledges that while Benjamin is the data owner and primary consent-giver, research examining cognitive patterns in neurodivergent populations benefits from multi-perspective oversight.

### Privacy Protection Measures

To protect Benjamin's identity while preserving analytical integrity:

**Pseudonymization**: Benjamin's real name, location, and personally identifying details have been replaced throughout all published materials.

**Selective Redaction**: Specific references to identifiable third parties, organizations, or unique personal circumstances have been redacted where they don't compromise the analytical findings.

**Preservation of Content**: Unlike traditional anonymization that might paraphrase or generalize, we preserve Benjamin's exact language where it demonstrates critical patterns (magical thinking, escalation language, frustration markers). This is essential for methodological validity - the research depends on precise linguistic analysis.

**No External Distribution of Raw Data**: The complete 89.5 MB dataset remains private. Published materials include only excerpts necessary for demonstrating findings.

## Data Characteristics

### Conversation Topics and Domains

Benjamin's conversations span multiple domains, reflecting his use of Claude as a general-purpose cognitive partner:

**Software Development** (approximately 30% of conversations): Code assistance, debugging help, architecture decisions, tool selection, and programming problem-solving.

**Creative Projects** (approximately 25%): Writing assistance, idea development, project planning, and creative exploration.

**Personal Decision-Making** (approximately 20%): Product recommendations, service comparisons, healthcare navigation, and life planning.

**Exploratory Thinking** (approximately 15%): Open-ended questions, knowledge acquisition, conceptual understanding, and intellectual curiosity.

**Administrative Tasks** (approximately 10%): Documentation help, communication drafting, organizational support, and procedural guidance.

This distribution reveals Claude functioning not as a specialized tool for one domain, but as a comprehensive cognitive prosthetic across Benjamin's life activities.

### Interaction Patterns

**Session Characteristics:**
- Average conversation length: 20.9 messages (range: 2 to 180+ messages)
- Average message length (Benjamin): 156 characters
- Average message length (Claude): 1,319 characters (8.4x longer)
- Longest single Claude response: 27,915 characters

**Temporal Distribution:**
- Concentrated usage periods: clusters of 10-20 conversations per day
- Gaps of 1-3 days between usage clusters
- Peak usage: weekday afternoons and evenings
- Session abandonment rate: 28.6% (conversations ending without clear resolution)

**Conversation Abandonment**: Over a quarter of conversations end without apparent resolution or closure. This high abandonment rate itself became a significant finding, particularly in decision paralysis and information overload contexts.

### Linguistic Features

Benjamin's communication style exhibits distinct patterns consistent with autistic communication preferences:

**Direct and Imperative**: Frequent use of commands rather than requests ("Tell me", "Show me", "List all", "Explain exactly")

**Precision-Seeking**: Demands for comprehensive, definitive information ("100% accurate", "absolute best", "tell me everything")

**Frustration Markers**: 378 instances of profanity or frustration expressions across conversations

**Metacommentary**: Explicit statements about Claude's performance ("You're not being clear enough", "That's too overwhelming", "Simplify this")

These linguistic patterns became key quantitative signals in the two-stage detection methodology.

## Why n=1 Longitudinal Design

### Advantages of Single-Subject Focus

**Deep Pattern Recognition**: With 255 conversations from one individual, we can identify personal patterns that would be obscured in averaged multi-subject data. Vicious cycles are often individual-specific - what triggers information overload in Benjamin might not affect another autistic person similarly.

**Controlled Confounds**: Multi-subject studies must account for countless variables: different cognitive profiles, different LLM usage histories, different life circumstances. Single-subject design eliminates between-subject variance.

**Ecological Validity**: Benjamin used Claude naturally, without knowing his interactions would later be analyzed. Multi-subject experimental designs often suffer from artificial usage patterns.

**Temporal Dynamics**: We can track how cycles evolve over time within a single cognitive system. Does information overload worsen with repeated exposure? Do certain interventions help? These questions require sustained observation of one person.

**Clinical Relevance**: Clinical practice often involves understanding one individual deeply rather than group averages. This research models the kind of detailed observation clinicians need.

### Limitations of n=1 Design

**Generalizability**: Findings emerge from Benjamin's specific cognitive profile, communication style, and LLM usage patterns. We cannot assume all autistic individuals experience identical cycles.

**Individual Variation**: Autism manifests differently across individuals. Benjamin's patterns reflect his particular combination of traits: uncertainty intolerance, executive dysfunction, superior verbal reasoning, theory of mind challenges.

**LLM-Specific Effects**: These findings emerge from interactions with Claude during a specific time period. Different LLMs (GPT, Gemini, etc.) might behave differently. Even Claude's behavior evolves with model updates.

**Temporal Constraints**: 26 days provides sufficient data for pattern detection but limited insight into longer-term adaptation or change. Do cycles persist over months? Years? We cannot answer this.

**Selection Bias**: Benjamin is someone who extensively uses AI assistance. Findings might not apply to autistic individuals who use LLMs minimally or differently.

### Addressing Generalizability Through Replication

Rather than claiming universal applicability, this research:

1. **Provides a methodology** that others can apply to different individuals, different LLMs, different populations
2. **Identifies hypotheses** for future multi-subject validation
3. **Demonstrates existence proofs** - these cycles CAN occur, even if not universally
4. **Offers clinical observations** that practitioners can watch for in their own clients

The value lies not in statistical generalization but in rich description of a phenomenon that might otherwise remain invisible.

## Data Integrity and Analytical Honesty

### No Modification Policy

The dataset represents authentic interaction history exactly as it occurred. We made no modifications to:
- Message content (beyond pseudonymization)
- Message order or timing
- Conversation structure
- Response lengths or formatting

This preservation is critical because the research examines emergent patterns in natural conversation flow. Editing would compromise analytical validity.

### Handling Incomplete Data

Some conversations lack clear resolution because:
- Benjamin abandoned the conversation (high cognitive load, distraction, satisfaction)
- The conversation reached a natural endpoint without explicit closure
- Claude's response was interrupted or not fully delivered

We coded these as "abandoned" rather than excluding them. Abandonment rates themselves became significant findings, particularly for decision paralysis analysis.

### Conversation Context Limitations

The exported data includes message content but not:
- Time spent reading Claude's responses before replying
- Copy-paste behavior or external research conducted between messages
- Conversations with other AI systems or people during the same period
- Benjamin's emotional or physiological state during interactions

These unmeasured factors undoubtedly influence interaction patterns but remain unavailable for analysis. We acknowledge this as a limitation rather than attempting to infer what cannot be measured.

### Versioning and Transparency

The exact dataset used for this analysis (conversations from October 20 - November 16, 2025) is documented with:
- Export date and method
- Claude model versions accessed during the period
- Any known technical issues or service interruptions
- Data structure and format specifications

This versioning enables future researchers to understand exactly what data underpinned our findings and to identify any temporal effects related to model updates or service changes during the study period.

## Conclusion

This dataset represents a rare window into authentic, intensive human-AI interaction with a neurodivergent user. The 26-day concentrated timeframe, high message volume, and diverse conversation topics provide sufficient richness for pattern detection while maintaining ecological validity.

The single-subject design trades breadth for depth, enabling identification of subtle patterns that might disappear in aggregated multi-subject data. While this limits statistical generalizability, it provides the kind of detailed observation necessary for understanding complex cognitive-technological interactions.

The ethical framework - informed consent, ongoing family approval, selective pseudonymization, and preservation of analytical integrity - balances privacy protection with research honesty. Benjamin's patterns deserve accurate representation, even when they reveal concerning dynamics.

Understanding these patterns requires data that is authentic, comprehensive, and preserved with integrity. This dataset meets those requirements, providing a foundation for the two-stage detection methodology described in subsequent sections.
